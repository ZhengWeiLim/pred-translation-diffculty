# Predicting Human Translation Difficulty Using Automatic Word Alignment

Results are shown and can be reproduced on `predicting-translation-difficulty.ipynb`.

Translation surprisal and entropy are calculated with `src/word_alignment_distribution.py`,
based on [awesome-align](https://github.com/neulab/awesome-align) 
output scores of [open subtitles](https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles-v2018.php).

Code for semantic alignment by [Thompson et al. (2020)](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10213620) is available 
[here](https://osf.io/tngba/).
